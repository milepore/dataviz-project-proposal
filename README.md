# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a series of Beer Reviews from BeerAdvocate from 2000 to 2011 that has been augmented with location information for the breweries of the beers reviewed.

This data was derrived from a project that I did for a Machine Learning course and can be found at this GitHub location:
[https://github.com/milepore/BeerStyleLocationAnalysis]

The data was derrived from a combination of the BeerAdvocate dataset [https://data.world/socialmediadata/beeradvocate] - aproxamately 1.5M beer reviews from 2000-2011.  This data was augmented by internet scraped location information, which was converted to GPS location via the Google Places API.

This gave us about 1M location-enhanced review records.  This was too much to visualize, so we added a summary by beer.  This gives us about 32,000 individual beer ratings with the following fields:
* Brewery (name, ID)
* Brewery Location (City, State, Country, Latitude, Longitude)
* Style (categorical)
* Beer Name
* Beer ABV
* Average Rating
* Number of reviews

Additionally we are going to augment this data with a "style category" field - where we take the 100+ styles that we have and reduce it to 15 style families.

The dataset has been made available in vizhub at:

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project.  The overall motivation is to allow a user
to explore the relationship between beer styles and locations:

* Visualize the rating of beers to their style relative to their geography
* Explore the relationship between beer style, rating and geography
* Allow someone to search for a brewery in a given area with high ratings
* Allow someone to search for a given beer style in a given area with a high rating
* Plot all beer ratings for a given style based on their geography
* Plot all beer ratings in a given area to let someone explore what to drink


## Sketches

I have created the following screen sketches for this project:

### Beer Style Explorer - Map View

![Map View](https://github.com/milepore/dataviz-project-proposal/blob/master/map.png?raw=true)]

This screen will Let the user explore the relationship between beer and geography.

* Data filter allows the user to pick the data of all reviews to show.
* Map view uses point marks to encode the location of beers that match the style of the filter
* Point marks are somewhat transparent - allowing density to be a signal
* Color encoding is used (red-green scale maybe) to indicate average review signal
* Could try and use shape signals to shows the style family (not direct style - there are too many, will process and group into families)

The user can change views with the tabs (map/graph/radar or parallel coordinates)

### Graph View

![Graph View](https://github.com/milepore/dataviz-project-proposal/blob/master/line-and-bar.png?raw=true)]

This shows the relationship between two different variables using bar marks and line marks

* Utilizing the same data filter section to allow you to pick the set of data you care about
* Each Variable can be set by the user to allow changing the graph up

Bar/Line (left and right axis) can be set to:
* # Beers
* # Breweries
* Avg Rating
* ABV
* # Reviews

Grouping can be set to:
* Style
* Country
* State (maybe)

### Radar View
![Radar View](https://github.com/milepore/dataviz-project-proposal/blob/master/radar.png?raw=true)]


I am undecided if I will implment this one.  I really like the way that these show changes as you go from one set of selected data to another -
especially if they are animated, but I may switch this out for the parallel coordinates view.

This view allows exploring a single attribute of the beer reviews selected across groupings

In this case, we are exploring rating vs style grouping

Signals are point / area across the various axis

Radius can be set to:
* # Beers
* # Breweries
* Avg Rating
* ABV
* # Reviews

Grouping can be set to:
* Style

### Parallel Coordinates View

![Parallel Coordinates View](https://github.com/milepore/dataviz-project-proposal/blob/master/parallel-coordinates.png?raw=true)]

Allows exploring how beers with similar attributes are related.

Shows how ABV, Rating and # reviews might be related.

Leverages color channel to show how style family is related.

Uses same filter to break things down

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's is the graph view, and shows several styles of beers, and the realationship of number of beers to average rating:

## Open Questions

The biggest uncertianties that I'm worried about is making the interactive filter elements work with D3.  While I have some experience using react, it has been pretty limited.  I may try and get that to work, or I might just do soem forms in vizhub.  Will explore the overall implementation.

The downside to this is that the filter doesn't have a ton to do with the actual visualizations, but everything to do with the tasks the user has to perform.  The visualizations, I'm not worried about too much at this point - although the map seems like it might be a little complicated, but I'm not super-worried yet.

## Milestones

* Week 9 - Map View of World Reviews
  ** Crated map of world reviews, with pan and zoom
  ** Updated data to include style families
* Week 9 - Data finalization, First Filter
** Adapt data to support style category
** Update data source to include # reviews
** Filter form to adapt data - a few fields
* Week 10 - First map view
* Week 11 - Experiment with Parallel Coordinate View
* Week 12 - Update Graph pseudo-viz to look at real data
* Week 13 - Finalize filter and interactivity, put it all together
* Week 14 - Buffer / finalize / write paper
