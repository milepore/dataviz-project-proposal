# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a series of Beer Reviews from BeerAdvocate from 2000 to 2011 that has been augmented with location information for the breweries of the beers reviewed.

This data was derrived from a project that I did for a Machine Learning course and can be found at this GitHub location:
[https://github.com/milepore/BeerStyleLocationAnalysis]

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is there any correlation between beer review rating, location and other attributes about a beer such as style or strength?
 ** Are there particular regions that have particularly good version of specific beers
 * What beers would be good to try if I am visiting a particular location
 * Are there more beers of a particular style that are brewed in a particular location

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

Also, you can study the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curran/dataviz-project-template-proposal/master/README.md) to figure out Markdown formatting. You can use the GitHub built-in editor to edit the document.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
